# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** November 30, 2025

BeautyTrack ("we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the BeautyTrack mobile application (the "App") collects, uses, and safeguards information when you manage inventory, receipts, and expenses on your iPhone or iPad. By installing or using the App you agree to this Policy. If you disagree with any part, please uninstall the App and discontinue use.

## 1. Information We Collect

- **Inventory and product entries.** Names, stock counts, SKU identifiers, purchase costs, reorder thresholds, and related notes you manually enter.
- **Expense and receipt information.** Suppliers, amounts, receipt images, parsed receipt data, categories, and notes recorded through manual entry or scanner imports.
- **Device permissions.** The App requests camera or photo library access when you scan or import receipts. Images are processed locally and remain on your device unless you export them.
- **Diagnostics.** Anonymous crash logs or performance metrics supplied by Apple. These diagnostics do not include personal identifiers and are used solely to improve stability.

The App does not require account registration, location data, or payment card details. Any optional personal information you include inside notes remains on-device unless you export data.

## 2. How We Use Information

We use collected information to:

- Deliver core functionality, including inventory calculations, usage forecasting, low-stock notifications, and expense summaries.
- Maintain accurate records when you adjust stock or import receipts.
- Respond to support requests and troubleshoot defects.
- Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.

We do not sell or rent your data and we do not share it with advertisers.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

- **On-device storage.** Inventory, expense, and receipt data are stored locally using Apple’s secure storage frameworks. Removing the App or resetting your device deletes the local database unless you exported a backup.
- **Backups.** If you enable iCloud or encrypted device backups, copies of the App’s database may be included in those system-level backups. Manage backup retention through your device settings.
- **Security practices.** BeautyTrack relies on iOS/iPadOS sandboxing, File Protection classes, and biometric/passcode controls. We recommend enabling a device passcode and Face ID or Touch ID.

## 4. Data Sharing

We share information only when necessary:

- With Apple Inc. to provide system services such as notifications, photo access, or app distribution.
- With service providers assisting with customer support or crash analytics, subject to confidentiality agreements.
- When required by law, regulation, subpoena, or court order, or to protect our rights or the rights and safety of others.

## 5. Your Choices

- **Permissions.** You can revoke camera or photo access at any time in iOS/iPadOS Settings. Some features may stop working if permissions are disabled.
- **Editing and deletion.** You may add, edit, or delete records directly inside the App. Deleting the App removes its local data store from the device.
- **Notifications.** Adjust low-stock notification preferences within the App or through system Settings > Notifications.

## 6. Children’s Privacy

BeautyTrack is intended for salon professionals and is not directed to children under 13. If we learn that we unintentionally collected information from a child under 13, we will delete it promptly.

## 7. International Considerations

The App stores data on the device where it is installed. Depending on your backup configuration, data may be transferred to Apple servers located in the United States or other jurisdictions where privacy laws may differ.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Policy to reflect legal, technical, or business developments. When we make material changes, we will highlight them within the App or release notes. Continued use after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.
