# Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** November 30, 2025

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the BeautyTrack mobile application (the "App"). By downloading, accessing, or using the App you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not install or use the App.

## 1. License Grant

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the App on any iOS or iPadOS device you own or control, strictly in accordance with these Terms and Apple’s App Store Terms of Service.

## 2. Permitted Use

You agree to:

- Use the App solely for managing salon or retail inventory, expenses, and related business records.
- Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards while using the App.
- Maintain accurate data and back up records regularly using the built-in export features or your own device backups.

## 3. Prohibited Conduct

You may not:

- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the App except where expressly permitted by law.
- Circumvent security features, use the App for unlawful activities, or transmit malicious code.
- Rent, lease, sell, sublicense, or redistribute the App or derived datasets to third parties without our written consent.

## 4. Data Ownership and Responsibility

You retain ownership of the inventory, receipt, and expense data you enter. You are solely responsible for the accuracy of that data and for complying with retention or reporting requirements that apply to your business. We provide export and import capabilities so you can maintain independent backups.

## 5. Third-Party Services

The App may integrate with system services provided by Apple (e.g., camera, photo library, notifications). Your use of those services is governed by Apple’s terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third-party services beyond our reasonable control.

## 6. Updates and Availability

We may provide updates that add, modify, or remove features. We are under no obligation to continue supporting older versions of the App. Downtime may occur due to maintenance, technical issues, or events beyond our control.

## 7. Disclaimers

THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOUR USE OF THE APP IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BEAUTYTRACK LLC AND ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE APP, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) TO DOWNLOAD THE APP.

## 9. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless BeautyTrack LLC from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your misuse of the App, violation of these Terms, or infringement of any third-party rights.

## 10. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time if we believe you have violated these Terms. Upon termination, the license granted to you ends immediately and you must cease using and uninstall the App.

## 11. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law principles. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California.

## 12. Changes to These Terms

We may modify these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated through in-app notices or release notes. Continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
